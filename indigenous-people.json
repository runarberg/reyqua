[{"id":6,"theme":"Indigenous People","title":"What does it mean to be indigenous?","content":"Just to start, I would like to suggest a discussion about the definition of “*indigenous*”. This word gets thrown around a lot to describe “tribal looking” people but what does it actually mean? The word suggests people of a native origin, the original people of a land, but does that make Icelandic people indigenous? The Polynesians made their way to New Zealand around the same time that Iceland was settled. There is absolutely no question about Maori being an indigenous group, but what about Icelanders? Following this logic, Icelanders would be considered indigenous. However, one of the main criteria for being indigenous requires self identification and since Icelanders do not self identify as indigenous (that I know of), they aren’t. So, even though there is no strict definition of “indigenous” there are defining factors like self identification. \n\nAdditionally I would like to suggest that “indigenousness” should not be thought of as a measure of how traditional a person or peoples are. It might seem obvious, but I think its important to keep in mind that no matter how traditional anybody may be, nobody lives in a box where time stands still. Things happen, technology changes, new ideas are formed and tradition transforms.  \n\nBelow are a couple of links that go further in describing who indigenous people are: \n* [First Peoples](http://www.firstpeoples.org/who-are-indigenous-peoples)  \n* [International Working Group for Indigenous Affairs](http://www.iwgia.org/culture-and-identity/identification-of-indigenous-peoples)","author":"Chantal","datetime":"2015-01-04T22:26:04.369Z","articleId":"What-does-it-mean-to-be-indigenous?","humanDate":"January, 4th","comments":[{"id":8,"theme":"Indigenous People","post":"What does it mean to be indigenous?","content":"It is interesting to ask why Icelanders don't think of them self (generally) as indigenous, but Polynesians do. Same goes with why Norwegian white folks don't while Norwegian Saamis do. I'm going to suggest that this indigenous identification is somewhat triggered by being colonized. But even then it's not so simple, because Greenland and Iceland were colonized by the same world power, yet Greenlanders consider themselves indigenous but not Icelanders. Perhaps it has something to do with the nature of colonization. While Denmark took the governance of Iceland in their own hands, they took the *culture* of Greenland and tried to make it theirs. Iceland has the luxury of sharing a large part of their colonial powers, hence they hardly lost any of their culture. In Greenland that is a different story. Now we can see that the white culture in Norway has emerged as the dominant one, hence white Norwegians are not indigenous, but the Saami Norwegians are.\n\nOf course, this is a vast oversimplification. But it gives us a lot to think about.","author":"Rúnar Berg","datetime":"2015-01-05T09:09:03.908Z"},{"id":19,"theme":"Indigenous People","post":"What does it mean to be indigenous?","content":"Well, obviously its a matter of being white or not.","author":"John","datetime":"2015-01-12T22:34:39.063Z"}]},{"id":14,"theme":"Indigenous People","title":"“Real Indian”","content":"![vimeo](http://vimeo.com/17388451)\n\nThis film is a University of Washington master’s thesis by Jonathan Tomhave.

As I got the explanation of the term's meaning I understood it perfectly, but at the same time I wondered why it was as important to some people as it seemed, and to some other people they seemed to be able to go on about their lives without giving it a second thought.\nI immediately thought of Harry Potter, as one should always do when trying to explain anything. I am reading the fifth book these days, probably for the 10th time as I read all the books on a regular bases. In this book the students of Hogwarts school are looking for a room to practise defensive spells and it must be a private and secret one as they are not supposed to have a group of their own to practise those spells. They come across a room that only reveals itself when there is need for it. It is called the Room of requirements, so when people are in need of something and walk past a certain wall inside the school a door protrudes and, according to the specific needs of the room-seeker, that sort of a room comes into existance. In theory, if one would be pissing one's pants the room would be a toilet etc. I am thinking if indigeneity is not somewhat similar to this room. If you need to think about your origins and if your origins are a part of your make-up as a person, then it is important and you will find it for you to work with. I am all Icelander, as far as I know, and I don't even identify as an Icelander. I never have felt any pride regarding being from this nation and not another one. I prefer British humour to Icelandic, I prefer German functionalism to the Icelandic chaos, I prefer French food to Icelandic, I prefer Chinese tea to Icelandic Braga-kaffi. I am not into nature or viking-stuff, I prefer hot temperature to cold weather. I never felt at home in this island, to tell you the truth. So I guess I never felt like this subject would be something to look into, as it rings no bell within me. Just like the room of requirement changes into whatever you need the most, my priorities might be on the opposite scale to indigeneity. I often wonder why people need to identify themselves with any group at all, and not just feel like the individual they are, with bits and pieces of influence and background scattered from all over the world. I would probably find a residency to write music and books, with a joint library if I would stumble upon a room of requirements.  Or a white-sand beach. With constant sunshine.

The results\nwere most often really sad for the indigenous cultures, and now only a\nfew of them remain. Often times the alien invaders also brought with\nthem flags of the motherland, such as the Spanish or the British flag,\nand proclaimed it as the flag that the indigenous people should\nrecognize as their own. Later the colonized nations got independence,\nor autonomy and designed their own flag. These new flags were the\nflags of the colonizers, descended from the alien invaders, not\nof the natives. However, in an effort to have indigenous cultures recognized, people have raised their own flags. Agnostic\ntowards their colonizers the flags are often designed with their own culture in mind. The last few\ndecades we have seen a surge in elaborately designed *flags of\nindigenous nations*.

It comes in several varieties, most famously, the\nseven striped rainbow flag of Cusco. The Wiphala actually exists in\nseveral varieties. It always consists of seven colors, with the middle color indicating a specific\nprovince of the old empire (white for Aymara for example). It dates to\npre-colonial times and was used in resistance conflicts against the\nconquistadores. However (as in most cases) the idea of a “national\nflag” is a European introduction and it wasn’t used as flag for\nrepresenting the indigenous nations of the Andes until late 16th or\nthe 17th century (as such it still predates the Peruvian flag\nintroduced 1825). Today the Wiphala is one of two national flags of\nBolivia (since 2009) and the official flag of Cusco. Otherwise they are\noften used by resistance movements throughout South America, as well\nas a symbol for cultural independence for people indigenous to Peru,\nBolivia and Ecuador, as well as parts of Argentina, Chile and\nColombia.\n\nBerber\n------\n\n![Berber Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Berber_flag.svg)\n\nThe [Berber nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people)\n(Imazighen) is indigenous to North Africa. Previously they have been\ncolonized by the Romans, the Jews, the Arabs, and finally the\nFrench. Currently they live in nation states composed of an Arab\nmajority. The origin of the flag is up to debate, but most sources\nseem to agree that it was designed in the 1970‘s at the\n[Berber Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_Academy), most\nlikely under the guidance of Muhend Aarav Bessaoud. The academy was established to\nstandardize and popularize several aspects of suppressed Berber\nlanguage and culture, most noticeably\n[the Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh)—their alphabet.\nThe ⵣ (ezza) in the middle of the flag is the central letter of\nAmazigh (ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ; often written ⵎⵣⵖ), the word Berber use to refer to\nthemselves, meaning *free man* in the Berber language. The colors\nrepresents the landscape of their homeland, with green mountains\nbetween the blue Mediterranean ocean, and the yellow Sahara\ndesert. The Berber Academy was dissolved by the French in 1978. But\nthe flag was adopted as the official flag of the Berber people in\n1998, although it still lacks official status from any nation state.\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berber_flag\n* http://www.fotw.us/flags/xb.html\n\nAustralian Aborigines\n---------------------\n\n![Australian Aboriginal Flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Australian_Aboriginal_Flag.svg)\n\nThe\n[Australian Aboriginal Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_Flag)\nwas designed by Aboriginal artist Harold Thomas in 1971.

In 1994 it caused a controversy when\n[Cathy Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Freeman) (a\nsprinter) carried it during her victory lap after she won the 200m\nsprint in the Commonwealth Games in Canada.

The flag that currently represents the Sámi nation was\ninaugurated in 1986. It was the result of the winning design by the\nartist Astrid Båhl. The precursor of that flag—first flown in a\nprotest against the planned Alta Dam in 1977—was designed by another\nSámi artist Synnøve Persen. The colors used for the flags are popular\non traditional Sámi clothing. The circle is a motif derived from\nthe shaman‘s drum and the poem “*Paiven parneh*” (*Sons of the Sun*)\nby Anders Fjellner (1795-1876). The circle therefore represents the sun\n(red) and the moon (blue). The flag received official status from\nNorway in 2003 as one of the national flags and has it‘s own\ncompulsory flag day of February 6, the Sámi National Day.

It was designed by the Inuit painter and\ngraphic designer Thue Christiansen in 1978. The upper white part of\nthe flag represents the Greenland glacier, the bottom red represents\nthe ocean around Greenland, with floating icebergs represented by the\nwhite part of the circle. The red part of the circle symbolizes the\nascending and descending sun bringing about the altering summer\nbrightness and winter darkness. It narrowly won a selection over the\nmuch more boring design of a green cross in a white background.

This is probably mostly due to the fact that I didn’t take any interest in being Japanese until I was in my teenage years and mostly grew up in the United States, but also partly due to the fact that the Japanese government has severely suppressed indigenous groups. Infact, its been less than a decade since the [Ainu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people), the indigenous people of the north were recognized as an official minority. While I don’t have any blood connection to the Ainu or to the [Ryukyuan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_people) of the south (that I am aware of), they are my closest ties to indigenous people next to my upbringing with Pacific Northwest Native American culture (which hardly counts as any connection).   \n\nI’ve spent some time looking for good videos and articles to inform myself and to share with everyone and in the process I have come to some conclusions. Of the two groups, Ainu and Ryukyuan, there is far more information available about the Ainu. There are many historical ethnographic photos and even films of the Ainu and modern interviews but there seems to be very little evidence that the Ryukyuan are even a distinct group other than their sadly [endangered languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages). This just goes to show what a powerful suppressive force the Japanese government can be. Additionally, in my search I learned of yet another group of people, on Hachijo Island south of Tokyo who speak an older form of Japanese. They are not considered an indigenous group, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the same suppressive forces were at play.\n\nHere is a kind of dated video (90’s), but it shows pretty well how the Ainu fit into Japanese society, their struggle for recognition and their effort to continue traditional practices. \n\n  ![yt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjBYtYAOsJc)\n","author":"Chantal","datetime":"2015-01-18T17:58:35.075Z","articleId":"Indigenous-Japan","humanDate":"January, 18th","comments":[{"id":28,"theme":"Indigenous People","post":"Indigenous Japan","content":"Here is some old film footage of the Ainu Bear Ceremony (1931).\nThis film is very sparsely narrated and can feel a little bit too long but I think it shows very well the traditional ceremonial culture of the Ainu, how they look and how they used to live (traditionally, as opposed to today). \n![yt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EelCX5zjTKU)","author":"Rúnar","datetime":"2015-01-20T20:17:17.717Z"},{"id":32,"theme":"Indigenous People","post":"Indigenous Japan","content":"Here is an interesting article about the need to revitalize Ryukyuan languages (I think its 5 languages and 750 dialects).

The first mission was a log and thatch structure dedicated on october 9, 1776 when the necessary church documents arrived. The present Mission Dolores was dedicated in 1791.\n\nThis is the so called birth place of San Francisco as we know it today and a block away is the [Mission Dolores, or Mission San Francisco de Asís](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_San_Francisco_de_As%C3%ADs). \n\n![Mission Dolores](http://www.sanfranciscodays.com/postcards/large/pc395-mission-dolores-photo.jpg)\n\nToday Mission Dolores is an active church and a tourist attraction/trap, you can pay some amount of money and take a tour.

Along with Friars and pioneers lay thousands of unnamed Native Americans in a mass grave. All other dead bodies take the 15 minute trip out of town to the [necropolis of Colma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colma,_California) (another fascinating story). When the spanish came to [California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), then Mexico, they set up missions (church/military compounds) to assimilate the native population, luring them in with material goods, relocating some of them and often holding them against their will.

Do I bow? Smile? Shake nervously? Or none of the above. I didn’t know how to act or feel, but I was excited to share my culture, and learn theirs.\n\nI went to Kenya, and spent my time in a remote village on the western side of the country. I called Ebukolo my home for three months. I lived in a small mud hut, made from cow dung, dirt and small sticks to help provide support. I fetched my water from a small river, down a long hill, and carried it back to the small home that sat on a small property with a larger home to share the land. \n\nI sat in darkness during the night. Sat under a large tree, watching children play during the day, and continued my daily chores, as if it was part of my normal routine. I got up every day, ate my breakfast, and then made the short walk to a small school, where I taught English as a volunteer. I returned home, cleaned the house, washed my clothes by hand in a bucket and laid them out to dry. Checked my water supply, and if needed, made the mile journey to the small river. Upon returning, I went to the local market, made of two kiosks, which sold modest goods and purchased what was needed for the evening dinner.  \n\nI learned from the locals how to live and survive with what they had, and not with what they could buy. I learned to work the land, and grind maize to make a local dish. I learned to plant, care for the cows, milk them and let them graze the land. I learned how to kill the animals and use everything they gave, in order to make their life meaningful. However, the most important thing learned, was that community helped in whatever way they could. This was evident when I came across a local women who was homeless. She had dirt that covered her face, because she was eating it to get the iron. The women who shared the property with me, my host mother, rushed to her side, invited the homeless women into the home, gave her a meal. She talked with her and soon sent her on her way. I told my host mother that it was kind to see her take care of this women in the way she did. However, my host mother didn’t understand why I praised her for an action that everyone in the village did as a normal way of life. She was a member of the community, therefore, it was everyone’s responsibility to take care of her.\n\nOne day I ate a pastry that was being sold on the side of the streets. To this day, I don’t know what the pastry was made from, but I do know that it made me sick. When my host mother came across me throwing up, she rushed me into the home. I knew why I was sick, and I knew that it would pass, but the look on her face did not share the same sentiment. After about thirty minutes of me throwing up and then rushing to the outhouse, she sent her son to the school to fetch the reverend. Not a doctor, or a nurse, or a car that could take me to the hospital, she wanted the reverend, to heal my wounds and pray for my safety. It wasn’t rational, but it was what she knew. He returned promptly, with his family, other colleagues and a few more individuals that I didn’t know. I laid on the bed, sweating, unsure of when I would throw up again. The reverend grabbed my hand, and prayed. \n\nThe rest of the community gathered around and prayed for my safety. They prayed to god that I would survive, make it to tomorrow. All I really wanted was to be left alone, allowed to sleep, and rest through the night. What I got was a community who cared, who looked out for their own, and made sure that the people they cared for was okay.\n\nThat was the start of a lesson that I learned about Africa, the community is strong, not from the individual or the chief, but strong because of the individuals. Everyone has a responsibility to raise the children, everyone has a responsibility to take care of the elderly and everyone has a responsibility to share with each other what they have to offer. \n\nWhat you think you know about Africa, think again. We often see only the negative part of Africa, and we have very strong images of this place, full of violence, full of hatred, full of political unrest, but I see the culture of Africa as peaceful. A place that has their moments of violence, and problems, but people that care for one another. Perhaps there are many lessons that we can learn from the indigenous people’s way of life. We can learn to use what we have, live off the land, and care for one another, as if they are family. \n","author":"David Hartness","datetime":"2015-01-25T18:36:41.210Z","articleId":"The-Indigenous-African-Culture","humanDate":"January, 25th","comments":[{"id":35,"theme":"Indigenous People","post":"The Indigenous African Culture","content":"A good read, some food for thought.

The integration of the CEE states and the sheer willingness of\nboth parties to unite can in my view be explained through a\n[social constructivist approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism)\nbut also through a rational one, even to the extent of\n[liberal intergovernmentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmentalism#European_Integration). Two\ncompelling arguments can be made to justify either view:\n\n ### # Rational argument  ### #\n\nArmed conflict had broken out between national groups within the\nregion and the risk of ethnic tension spiralling out of control was\nconsidered high. The EU and NATO could not just stand by as the\nsituation either calmed down or escalated. Given that the prime\nconcern was to ensure the power balance within Europe, and to secure\nfurther development of the capitalized world, the integration of the\nCEE countries was considered necessary.\n\n ### # Socially constructive argument  ### #\n\nMost of the CEE states did openly express their eagerness to rejoin\nEurope as soon as the iron curtain fell and in that light the European\nCouncil announced ‘that the associated countries in Central and\nEastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European\nUnion.’ (Nugent, 2010, p. 42). The announcement was followed by a list\nof conditions, the Copenhagen criteria, which the CEEC’s had to meet,\nbut the spirit of the announcement suggests a European identity of\nshare values and norms and thus a social constructive explanation.\n\nIn order to determine which one of these arguments give a more\naccurate picture of the CEEC integration we need to examine more\nclosely the actions and decisions made by both parties, leading to,\nand during the accession negotiations. By examining the rule transfer\nprocess I believe I can decipher if the CEEC integration was driven by\nsecurity issues or by a shared European identity. In that regard I\nbase my analysis on Frank Schimmelfennig’s and Ulrich Sedelmeier’s\n2004 article Governance by conditionality: EU rule transfer to the\ncandidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Will Kymlicka’s\nanalysis of the CEEC/EU relations in *Multicultural Odysseys –\nNavigating the new International Politics of Diversity* 2007.\nSchimmelfenning and Sedelmeier analyze the case through a ‘governance\napproach’ and look specifically at how those rules and norms where\ntransferred. Although ‘government approaches’ are generally used for\n‘policy network analysis’ within the EU, Schimmelfenning and\nSedelmeier claim that it serves a useful tool for external relations\nanalysis as well (Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 1). To look\nmore closely at the issue of national minorities Kymlicka’s analysis\noffers a vital insight of the case, for he believes that in order to\nfully secure democracy as a just international norm; we must first and\nforemost secure the rights and autonomy of national minority\ngroups. Only then can we create a normative foundation for developing\nhuman rights, without which democracy is nothing but an illusion\n(Kymlicka, 2001, p. 69). Whether or not the EU offered membership to\nthe CEEC based on self-interests or not can by determined from\nKymlicka’s analysis.\n\t\t\n ###  Approaching governance  ### \n\n[The Copenhagen criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria)\nincluded various issues of reforms, including minority rights in the\nregion. From the liberal multiculturalist point of view the CEEC\nintegration process offered an opportunity to address humanitarian\nissues regarding the mistreatment of national minorities in the\npost-communist states. The EU did without a doubt manage to diffuse\nhumanitarian norms from the west, to the east, but it’s been a matter\nof some debate if the method and the norms themselves did to any\nextent offer a permanent solution.\n\nThe integration process was time-consuming and involved hard\nnegotiations as the pending member states where expected to meet the\ndemanding conditions of the Copenhagen criteria (and subsequently the\n*acquis communautaire*), including economic, democratic and humanitarian\nreforms (Nugent, 2010, p. 43). The EU’s strategy was to implement a\nrule transfer scheme in order to elevate the candidate countries to\nWestern-European standard so that their new membership wouldn’t have a\nnegative impact on the EU’s prosperity.\n\nIn Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier’s article they offer three different\nmodels of the EU’s external governance on CEEC’s rule adoption and\nanalyze their effectiveness in implementing EU legislation into\ndomestic law: ‘The social learning model’, ‘the lesson-drawing model’\nand ‘the external incentives model’, which seemed to be applied the\nmost.  The logic behind the ‘the external incentives model’ was to\nuses carrots and sticks as conditions to further accession.\n\nOverall the rule transfer proved rather context-dependent. The\ndemocratic conditionality turned out to be least effective, as none of\nthe three modes contributed to that area, especially for the most\nnationalist and authoritarian states. This can be explained by the\nfact that democratic reforms threatened the power position of the\npolitical elite which found the adoption cost to be too high\n(Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 10). Of the three models ‘the\nexternal incentive model’ seemed most effective in regards to the\n*acquis* conditionality, especially when applied with a credible\nmembership perspective. Also the *acquis* conditionality did not\ninterfere as much with domestic power politics as the democratization\ndid.\n\nThe social learning and lesson drawing models explained economic\nreforms and environmental issues in some cases as those rules had\nbeen implemented before the EU set the bar. This was also the case\nwith Hungary and Poland as they had started working on minority\nprotection as soon as the Soviet Union seized to exist. Also, in\nregards to those alternative models ‘the presence or absence of\nepistemic communities promoting EU rules emerges as a key factor’\n(Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 13). The external incentives\nmodel is a rather rational approach to the integration process of the\nCEEC countries. It rests on various factors but they conclude that the\neffectiveness of rule transfer rests primarily on the willingness of\nthe third country to join the union. All of the CEEC countries\nexpressed their will to join the EU as soon as the iron curtain fell\n(Nugent, 2010, p. 47). With that fact in mind, and also because they\nhad nowhere else to go, the EU was in full control of negotiations\nwith an strong bargaining position capable of offering rewards hard to\nresist. This can lead to a seemingly coercive rule transfer, which\nmight prove ineffective in the long run as the rules for the\nenlargement acquis where designed for accession candidates and not\nbinding for full members (Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 16).\n\nSchimmelfenning and Sedelmeier found evidence implying that ‘[r]ules\nthat are transferred through social learning or lesson-drawing are\nmuch less contested domestically (Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004,\np. 14).  Concluding that if the CEE countries where conditioned,\ninstead of persuaded, to accept external governance through\ncost-benefit analysis they might reverse some, or even all, of the\nreforms as soon as membership is insured. In other words, the carrot\nand stick strategy only works while the carrot hangs on the\nstring. They also noted that some member states and parts of the\nCommission ‘indicated that rather superficial alignment would not\npresent an obstacle to concluding negotiations in the areas of EU\nsocial policy’ (Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 13).\n    \n ###  Minority rights and autonomy  ### \n\nIn order to understand Will Kymlicka’s point of view we must look in\nto his philosophical premise. As a political philosopher his work has\nto a large extent revolved around the ontological misunderstanding of\nwestern individualism as a building block of human\nsociety. Rational/liberal individualism can be traced back to the\npolitical analysis of the enlightenment from\n*state-of-nature-theorists* and philosophers such as David Hume, John\nLocke, Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Although not fully\ncompatible theorists they share a fundamental ontological view of the\nindividual as a rational being, forming a societal realm of\ngovernance.  Kymlicka fears that by accepting the ontological view of\na ‘bottom up’ social structure, it will lead to a normative\nhomogeneity and injustices towards national minorities and indigenous\npeople. He argues that individuals form identities through interaction\nwith their socially constructed reality, indicating a ‘bottom up/top\ndown’ ontology. Liberal western individualism in fact assumes one\nworld view, cosmopolitanism, which denies those who wish to define\ntheir individuality from their national culture from leading a\nmeaningful life. As an attempt to prevent the injustice of\nhomogenising nation states Kymlicka suggests a diffusing of liberal\nmulticultural models of the state and citizenship through\nInternational organizations (Kymlicka, 2001, p. 307).\n\nIn his view, *institutionalizing* minority rights is of the outmost\nimportance and the key to a stabilized Europe once the CEEC’s join the\nEU. The solution rests not only in institutionalizing minority rights\non the basis of the UN’s declaration of ‘generic minority rights’\nwhich applies to all ethnocultural minorities, but through ‘targeted\nrights’. ‘Targeted rights’ apply to particular types of minorities\n‘such as indigenous peoples, national minorities, immigrants, the\nRoma/gypsies, and so on’ (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 199). Kymlicka claims\nthat the initial drive for the EU’s initial 1990 OSCE Copenhagen\nDeclaration was a ‘complex mixture of humanitarian, self interested,\nand ideological, reasons’ (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 174). The declaration\nstrongly supported minority rights and endorsed territorial autonomy\nfor national minorities. Following the declaration Kymlicka identifies\nthree strategies formulated by the EU to help improve state-minority\nrelations: ‘Publicizing best practices’; ‘formulating minimum\nstandard’; and ‘case specific interventions’.  All of the three tracks\nfailed miserably according to Kymlicka. The best practices strategy,\ndesigned to introduce previously successful western models of\nminority-majority relations, simply failed to convey the message for\nthe epistemic community completely overlooked the underlying cultural\ndifference between eastern and western Europe. When confronted with\nthe problem in the west, most of the humanitarian norms we take for\ngranted already existed.\n\nBy formulating minimum standards, and this brings us to\nSchimmelfenning and Sedelmeier and the external incentive model, the\nEU made a number of tremendous mistakes leading to the abandonment of\nuseful multicultural norms. In 1993 all of the major European\norganizations had developed a consensus to establish minimum norms and\nstandards of minority groups, and they all endorsed territorial\nautonomy. The problem was that no one seemed to have a clear idea what\nthese standards should be or how to formulate them. Again the\nepistemic community failed as the short timeframe resulted in norms\nwith serious limitations (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 199). Another critical\nissue regarding minimum standards and probably the main reason for the\nfailure of the whole experiment was the fact that these minimum\nstandards were off course intended to apply to all member states of\nthe EU. But as it turned out, the current member states could not\nabide to that. ‘While they were willing to insist that the\npost-communist states be monitored for their treatment of minorities,\nWestern democracies did not want their own treatment of national\nminorities examined (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 210). By resisting their own\nnorm diffusion the western part of the EU self-destructed further\nprogress leading to the diffusion of minority self-government. As the\npost-communist countries strongly opposed all ideas in that matter,\nbased on security reasons, the idea was dropped and subsequently all\nefforts to promote something like liberal multiculturalism disappeared\n(Kymlicka, 2007, p. 211). The case specific interventions according to\nKymlicka are misleading and rest on the logic of security instead of\nmulticulturalism. Conflict prevention may turn out effective but it\nresults in a *double-standard-dilemma* as the actions taken by the EU\n‘have demonstrated their preparedness to follow any policy measure to\ncreate stability’ (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 233). Kymlicka concludes by\nsaying that it has become the norm to deal with minority issues in the\npost-communist states by calculating actions about how to restore\nsecurity. In his view the CEEC integration process opened a window for\nimplementing a liberal-multicultural norm for all of Europe, ‘but the\nwindow has gradually closed, with the job only half-done (Kymlicka,\n2007, p. 315).\n\n ###  Conclusion  ### \n\nEven though Kymlica’s analysis rested on a much narrower viewpoint his\nconclusions are consistent with the findings of Schimmelfenning and\nSedelmeier, which underlines the contextual momentum of state-minority\nrelations in the CEEC/EU relationship.\n\nThis case is extremely complicated. Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier\nnote that even though the integration of the CEEC can be explained\ninitially through a shared European identity, the EU approached the\naccession through a fair share of what is commonly called old\ngovernance (Schimmelfennig & Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 16). The accession\nmeetings had the aura of an old fashion, top down hegemonies where the\nEU explained what needed to be reformed, how it should be done and\nwhat the prize was in return. It’s obvious that the EU made a mistake\nin going in to the accession negotiations with a “one size fits all”\nrule transfer model thus failing to diffuse important humanitarian\nnorms such as minority rights and sustaining democratic reforms. I\nfind that the methodology of the rule transfer applied by the EU to be\nrational and that the actors on both sides performed as\nutility-maximizers as the CEE countries where subjected to substantial\nexternal governance. As the case progressed I noted a tendency of self\ninterests from member states coherent with\n[rational choice institutionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_institutionalism),\nbut not\n[liberal institutionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_liberalism),\nfor I found that the states acknowledged the institutional\nframework. In the case of member states accepting superficial\nalignment to the *acquis* it indicates a lack of commitment on behalf\nof the EU, and I wonder why. Perhaps they were hoping for the\nsuperficial alignment to spill over into a more determent domestic\nreforms.\n\nIn my view the EU overestimated the kinship of the formerly divided\ncontinent, hurling the accession negotiation it to a setting of ‘old\npolitics’ and because of the strong institutional ‘path dependency’\nwithin the EU framework they lost control of the process.\n\n \n ###  Bibliography  ### \n\n* Eriksen, E.
