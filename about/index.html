<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a> is a
particular type of unofficial learning institution. In the late 19<span class="ord">th</span>
and early 20<span class="ord">th</span> century there was a community education movement that
started at Chautauqua Lake, New York. As the movement gained
popularity, “pop-up” sites were also called Chautauquas. Chautauquas
took different forms, from brick and mortar institutions to roving
tents but always featured entertaining lectures. Although the
Chautauqua movement has long since died, traces of it still remain and
we would like to revive the spirit of Chautauqua using a contemporary
platform, the&nbsp;internet!</p>
<p>For those of you who know us from our
<a href="http://solvallagata-braedraborgarstigur-cinema.neocities.org/history.html">Basement Cinema</a>,
we are excited to present the next phase. This time around we would
like to transcend beyond entertainment, our cinema will be just one
dimension of our Chautauqua. We will have monthly screenings that
correspond to our current topic, and hopefully with popularity we will
add more screenings (both feature length and&nbsp;shorts).</p>
<p>Our website will be the main platform of our forum and participation
is highly recommended! Each month we’ll have a different topic that
everyone can contribute to. The success of Reykjavík Chautauqua relies
heavily on the participation and comments of others and the diversity
of perspectives, otherwise it would just be us ranting on a blog… Our
goal isn’t political or necessarily intellectual, we just want to have
fun while learning and exploring some things that we find interesting,
and we welcome you to join&nbsp;us.</p>
<h2>Who are we</h2>
<p>Our names are <a href="mailto:c_uto@hotmail.com">Chantal Uto</a> and
<a href="mailto:runarberg@zoho.com">Rúnar Berg</a>, we live in Reykjavík and like
to have fun. We have the most fun when we are learning and doing
something new. This is the kind of experience that we are trying to
share at our new web space. We really like pizza, icecream and coffee,
but not necessarily at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<h2>How did we make this so&nbsp;pretty</h2>
<p>We use good amount of free and open source tools. Most noticeably the
beautiful font faces we use are
<a href="http://vollkorn-typeface.com/">Vollkorn</a> for the heading and
<a href="http://aldusleaf.org/0-crimson.html">Crimson Text</a> for the
paragraphs. Our app is powered by <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>
that runs on <a href="nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. We are happy to show you
<a href="https://github.com/runarberg/reykjavik-chautauqua">our code</a> as&nbsp;well.</p>
