Why?
Well, we felt that it would be a nice preamble to future topics,
setting some context and some kind of a flow. Its also a little bit
arbitrary, but we hope that you like our choice.</p>
<p>Although we want to explore the diversity (and similarity) of
traditional art, costume and custom, we want to go beyond a
superficial appreciation of aesthetics and also take a look at the
modern role of indigenous people around the world. What is the status
of indigenous people living more traditional lifestyles versus
indigenous people living in urban settings? What does history tell us?
What are some current issues? What are some cool projects? Etc.</p>

This word gets thrown around a lot to describe “tribal looking” people but what does it actually mean? The word suggests people of a native origin, the original people of a land, but does that make Icelandic people indigenous? The Polynesians made their way to New Zealand around the same time that Iceland was settled. There is absolutely no question about Maori being an indigenous group, but what about Icelanders? Following this logic, Icelanders would be considered indigenous. However, one of the main criteria for being indigenous requires self identification and since Icelanders do not self identify as indigenous (that I know of), they aren’t. So, even though there is no strict definition of “indigenous” there are defining factors like self&nbsp;identification.</p>
<p>Additionally I would like to suggest that “indigenousness” should not be thought of as a measure of how traditional a person or peoples are. It might seem obvious, but I think its important to keep in mind that no matter how traditional anybody may be, nobody lives in a box where time stands still. Things happen, technology changes, new ideas are formed and tradition&nbsp;transforms.</p>
<p>Below are a couple of links that go further in describing who indigenous people&nbsp;are:</p>

Same goes with why Norwegian white folks don’t while Norwegian Saamis do. I’m going to suggest that this indigenous identification is somewhat triggered by being colonized. But even then it’s not so simple, because Greenland and Iceland were colonized by the same world power, yet Greenlanders consider themselves indigenous but not Icelanders. Perhaps it has something to do with the nature of colonization. While Denmark took the governance of Iceland in their own hands, they took the <em>culture</em> of Greenland and tried to make it theirs. Iceland has the luxury of sharing a large part of their colonial powers, hence they hardly lost any of their culture. In Greenland that is a different story. Now we can see that the white culture in Norway has emerged as the dominant one, hence white Norwegians are not indigenous, but the Saami Norwegians&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a vast oversimplification. But it gives us a lot to think&nbsp;about.</p>

<p>This film is a University of Washington master’s thesis by Jonathan Tomhave. It is a nice follow up to the question of what it means to be indigenous. The film is composed of interviews with four Native American people who talk about what it means to be a “real indian”. The question isn’t so much a serious question (if it were, I wouldn’t post this video) as opposed to a means of showing how people identify and define themselves in different&nbsp;ways.</p>

</div></div><div class="comment"><p class="author"><span class="author-name">Chantal</span> says</p><div class="comment-content"><h2>Defending Walt Whitman</h2>
<p>By Sherman Alexie</p>
<p>Basketball is like this for young Indian boys, all arms and legs<br>
and serious stomach muscles. Every body is brown!<br>
These are the twentieth-century warriors who will never kill,<br>
although a few sat quietly in the deserts of Kuwait,<br>
waiting for orders to do something, to do&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>God, there is nothing as beautiful as a jumpshot<br>
on a reservation summer basketball court<br>
where the ball is moist with sweat,<br>
and makes a sound when it swishes through the net<br>
that causes Walt Whitman to weep because it is so&nbsp;perfect.</p>
<p>There are veterans of foreign wars here<br>
although their bodies are still dominated<br>
by collarbones and knees, although their bodies still respond<br>
in the ways that bodies are supposed to respond when we are young.<br>
Every body is brown! Look there, that boy can run<br>
up and down this court forever. He can leap for a rebound<br>
with his back arched like a salmon, all meat and bone<br>
synchronized, magnetic, as if the court were a river,<br>
as if the rim were a dam, as if the air were a ladder<br>
leading the Indian boy toward&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>Some of the Indian boys still wear their military hair cuts<br>
while a few have let their hair grow back.<br>
It will never be the same as it was before!<br>
One Indian boy has never cut his hair, not once, and he braids it<br>
into wild patterns that do not measure anything.<br>
He is just a boy with too much time on his hands.<br>
Look at him. He wants to play this game in bare&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>God, the sun is so bright! There is no place like this.<br>
Walt Whitman stretches his calf muscles<br>
on the sidelines. He has the next game.<br>
His huge beard is ridiculous on the reservation.<br>
Some body throws a crazy pass and Walt Whitman catches it<br>
with quick hands. He brings the ball close to his nose<br>
and breathes in all of its smells: leather, brown skin, sweat,<br>
black hair, burning oil, twisted ankle, long drink of warm water,<br>
gunpowder, pine tree. Walt Whitman squeezes the ball tightly.<br>
He wants to run. He hardly has the patience to wait for his turn.<br>
“What’s the score?” he asks. He asks, “What’s the&nbsp;score?”</p>
<p>Basketball is like this for Walt Whitman. He watches these Indian boys<br>
as if they were the last bodies on earth. Every body is brown!<br>
Walt Whitman shakes because he believes in God.<br>
Walt Whitman dreams of the Indian boy who will defend him,<br>
trapping him in the corner, all flailing arms and legs<br>
and legendary stomach muscles. Walt Whitman shakes<br>
because he believes in God. Walt Whitman dreams<br>
of the first jumpshot he will take, the ball arcing clumsily<br>
from his fingers, striking the rim so hard that it sparks.<br>
Walt Whitman shakes because he believes in God.<br>
Walt Whitman closes his eyes. He is a small man and his beard<br>
is ludicrous on the reservation, absolutely insane.<br>
His beard makes the Indian boys righteously laugh. His beard<br>
frightens the smallest Indian boys. His beard tickles the skin<br>
of the Indian boys who dribble past him. His beard, his&nbsp;beard!</p>
<p>God, there is beauty in every body. Walt Whitman stands<br>
at center court while the Indian boys run from basket to basket.<br>
Walt Whitman cannot tell the difference between<br>
offense and defense. He does not care if he touches the ball.<br>
Half of the Indian boys wear t-shirts damp with sweat<br>
and the other half are bareback, skin slick and shiny.<br>
There is no place like this. Walt Whitman smiles.<br>
Walt Whitman shakes. This game belongs to&nbsp;him.</p>

I came across this video while I was putting together the preshow for our upcoming screening. Unfortunately, it is too long for the preshow but I would still like to share it because I think it tells an interesting narrative from a valuable perspective. What I was looking for was a video that could shortly go through the polynesian migration to New Zealand. Typically these types of videos feature some pompous guy performing narrative gymnastics and using hyperbolic language…lame…but this video features two young, goofy guys, one Maori and the other Samoan, retracing their genes. They are just regular guys so its pretty relatable and really informative. Did you know that Polynesians originate in Taiwan, I&nbsp;didn’t!</p>

As I got the explanation of the term’s meaning I understood it perfectly, but at the same time I wondered why it was as important to some people as it seemed, and to some other people they seemed to be able to go on about their lives without giving it a second thought.
I immediately thought of Harry Potter, as one should always do when trying to explain anything. I am reading the fifth book these days, probably for the 10<span class="ord">th</span> time as I read all the books on a regular bases. In this book the students of Hogwarts school are looking for a room to practise defensive spells and it must be a private and secret one as they are not supposed to have a group of their own to practise those spells. They come across a room that only reveals itself when there is need for it. It is called the Room of requirements, so when people are in need of something and walk past a certain wall inside the school a door protrudes and, according to the specific needs of the room-seeker, that sort of a room comes into existance. In theory, if one would be pissing one’s pants the room would be a toilet etc. I am thinking if indigeneity is not somewhat similar to this room. If you need to think about your origins and if your origins are a part of your make-up as a person, then it is important and you will find it for you to work with. I am all Icelander, as far as I know, and I don’t even identify as an Icelander. I never have felt any pride regarding being from this nation and not another one. I prefer British humour to Icelandic, I prefer German functionalism to the Icelandic chaos, I prefer French food to Icelandic, I prefer Chinese tea to Icelandic Braga-kaffi. I am not into nature or viking-stuff, I prefer hot temperature to cold weather. I never felt at home in this island, to tell you the truth. So I guess I never felt like this subject would be something to look into, as it rings no bell within me. Just like the room of requirement changes into whatever you need the most, my priorities might be on the opposite scale to indigeneity. I often wonder why people need to identify themselves with any group at all, and not just feel like the individual they are, with bits and pieces of influence and background scattered from all over the world. I would probably find a residency to write music and books, with a joint library if I would stumble upon a room of requirements.  Or a white-sand beach. With constant sunshine. Oh the&nbsp;sunshine.</p>

I would like to think of the room of requirements changing over time. I think there was a point in time where I felt like I needed to figure out my cultural identity,  I thought it was embarrassing that I felt that way but it was just some weird burning desire I couldn’t shake and a strange loneliness. I can’t really explain the feeling. And then I explored and I felt at ease and now I don’t think about it anymore. Today my room of requirements would probably look like an art&nbsp;studio.</p>

A way to reach for the freedom they might lack. We, the free Western and spoiled have never known oppression on our own skin, and that was sort of what I meant. I recognize the importance for it, for others than myself. I would simply like the world to be a place where people have the freedom to look for their own individual texture, without any specific gender, race or nation. I don’t know when the world is ready for that, but I am and have been a long time, so I cannot think differently about&nbsp;this.</p>

brought with them new habits, new religion and a new language and
introduced them to the native folks living there. The results
were most often really sad for the indigenous cultures, and now only a
few of them remain. Often times the alien invaders also brought with
them flags of the motherland, such as the Spanish or the British flag,
and proclaimed it as the flag that the indigenous people should
recognize as their own. Later the colonized nations got independence,
or autonomy and designed their own flag. These new flags were the
flags of the colonizers, descended from the alien invaders, not
of the natives. However, in an effort to have indigenous cultures recognized, people have raised their own flags. Agnostic
towards their colonizers the flags are often designed with their own culture in mind. The last few
decades we have seen a surge in elaborately designed <em>flags of
indigenous nations</em>. This article attempts to describe a few of
these&nbsp;flags.</p>
<h2>Andes Indians</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Banner_of_the_Qulla_Suyu.svg" alt="Whiphala"></figure><p></p>
<p>The earliest example of an indigenous flag that I found is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiphala">the <em>Wiphala</em></a>—the flag of the
indigenous Andes. It comes in several varieties, most famously, the
seven striped rainbow flag of Cusco. The Wiphala actually exists in
several varieties. It always consists of seven colors, with the middle color indicating a specific
province of the old empire (white for Aymara for example). It dates to
pre-colonial times and was used in resistance conflicts against the
conquistadores. However (as in most cases) the idea of a “national
flag” is a European introduction and it wasn’t used as flag for
representing the indigenous nations of the Andes until late 16<span class="ord">th</span> or
the 17<span class="ord">th</span> century (as such it still predates the Peruvian flag
introduced 1825). Today the Wiphala is one of two national flags of
Bolivia (since 2009) and the official flag of Cusco. Otherwise they are
often used by resistance movements throughout South America, as well
as a symbol for cultural independence for people indigenous to Peru,
Bolivia and Ecuador, as well as parts of Argentina, Chile and&nbsp;Colombia.</p>
<h2>Berber</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Berber_flag.svg" alt="Berber Flag"></figure><p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people">Berber nation</a>
(Imazighen) is indigenous to North Africa. Previously they have been
colonized by the Romans, the Jews, the Arabs, and finally the
French. Currently they live in nation states composed of an Arab
majority. The origin of the flag is up to debate, but most sources
seem to agree that it was designed in the 1970‘s at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_Academy">Berber Academy</a>, most
likely under the guidance of Muhend Aarav Bessaoud. The academy was established to
standardize and popularize several aspects of suppressed Berber
language and culture, most noticeably
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh">the Tifinagh</a>—their alphabet.
The ⵣ (ezza) in the middle of the flag is the central letter of
Amazigh (ⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖ; often written ⵎⵣⵖ), the word Berber use to refer to
themselves, meaning <em>free man</em> in the Berber language. The colors
represents the landscape of their homeland, with green mountains
between the blue Mediterranean ocean, and the yellow Sahara
desert. The Berber Academy was dissolved by the French in 1978. But
the flag was adopted as the official flag of the Berber people in
1998, although it still lacks official status from any nation&nbsp;state.</p>

<h2>Australian Aborigines</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Australian_Aboriginal_Flag.svg" alt="Australian Aboriginal Flag"></figure><p></p>
<p>The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_Flag">Australian Aboriginal Flag</a>
was designed by Aboriginal artist Harold Thomas in 1971. It is one of
few indigenous flags that hold official status as a national flag in
the homeland. It received that status by the Australian government in 1995. In 1994 it caused a controversy when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_Freeman">Cathy Freeman</a> (a
sprinter) carried it during her victory lap after she won the 200m
sprint in the Commonwealth Games in Canada. The colors of the flag
represent the people (black), the earth (red), and the sun (yellow)
and placement represents the spiritual&nbsp;relations.</p>
<h2>Lakota</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Pine_Ridge_Flag.svg" alt="Oglala Sioux Flag"></figure><p></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_people">The Lakota people</a> of
North- and South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana have long
battled the federal government of the United States of America for
both autonomy and compensations for lost land and resources. On many occasions there have been violent confrontations
between Lakota activists and the Federal police. Understandably the
Lakota people rather flag their own flag than the flag of their
oppressors (and if they do they flag it upside down as a sign of
distress). The most noticeable of the Lakota flags is that of the
Pineridge reservation occupied by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglala_Lakota">Oglala Sioux</a> Indians in
South Dakota. Eight white tepees, represent the eight districts of
the reservation, the circle is symbolic of unity and
continuity. The red color has many meanings, including the blood shed
by the Sioux in defense of their lands, the red paint used decorate
the face and hair parting in ceremonies, and cloth used to wrap
offerings to their creator. The flag was first displayed in 1961 at the
Sun Dance ceremonies and was approved in 1962 by the Oglala Sioux
Tribal&nbsp;Council.</p>

<h2>Sámi</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Sami_flag.svg" alt="Sámi Flag"></figure><p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people">Sámi people</a> are
indigenous of northern Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula of
Russia. The area of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1pmi_(area)">Sápmi</a> crosses
four national borders which has been troublesome for this
herding nation. The flag that currently represents the Sámi nation was
inaugurated in 1986. It was the result of the winning design by the
artist Astrid Båhl. The precursor of that flag—first flown in a
protest against the planned Alta Dam in 1977—was designed by another
Sámi artist Synnøve Persen. The colors used for the flags are popular
on traditional Sámi clothing. The circle is a motif derived from
the shaman‘s drum and the poem “<em>Paiven parneh</em>” (<em>Sons of the Sun</em>)
by Anders Fjellner (1795-1876). The circle therefore represents the sun
(red) and the moon (blue). The flag received official status from
Norway in 2003 as one of the national flags and has it‘s own
compulsory flag day of February 6, the Sámi National Day. However it
has yet to receive official status from the other three nation states
with Sámi&nbsp;habitation.</p>

<h2>Mapuche</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Flag_of_the_Mapuches.svg" alt="Mapuche Flag"></figure><p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapuche">Mapuche</a> Indians of
Southern Chile and Argentina were among the last thriving Indian
nation to be annexed. They successfully resisted the Spanish
conquistadors in the 16<span class="ord">th</span> century. And thrived as an independent state
until Chilean and Argentinian expansion periods of the latter half of
the 19<span class="ord">th</span> century. A century later, efforts to rebel against the annexation
continue. In an effort to create the Mapuche nation in 1991 a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Mapuches#In_Chile">Mapuche national flag</a>
was adopted. It hasn’t received an official status&nbsp;yet.</p>

<h2>Greenland</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Flag_of_Greenland.svg" alt="Greenland Flag"></figure><p></p>
<p>Greenland flagged the Danish flag as their national flag until 1985
when it adopted the current flag. It was designed by the Inuit painter and
graphic designer Thue Christiansen in 1978. The upper white part of
the flag represents the Greenland glacier, the bottom red represents
the ocean around Greenland, with floating icebergs represented by the
white part of the circle. The red part of the circle symbolizes the
ascending and descending sun bringing about the altering summer
brightness and winter darkness. It narrowly won a selection over the
much more boring design of a green cross in a white background. It is
now often flagged along side the Danish&nbsp;flag.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Greenland">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Greenland</a></li>

<h2>Māori</h2>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Tino_Rangatiratanga_Maori_sovereignty_movement_flag.svg" alt="Tino Rangatiratanga"></figure><p></p>
<p>the phrase
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_rangatiratanga"><em>“tino rangatiratanga”</em></a>
means ‘absolute sovereignty’ in the Māori language and a flag based of
that term has become the de-facto Māori national flag—the flag of the
indigenous people in New Zealand. It was designed by Hiraina Marsden,
Jan Smith and Linda Munn in 1990 and symbolizes the creation myth
Rangi and Papa, depicting the sky, the earth, and the physical realm
of light and being which was created when they were separated. It has
been flown by activists and protesters frequently since then. The
New Zealand government has been reluctant to grant it any official
status alongside the flag of New Zealand. However, in 2009 the New
Zealand government flagged it along side the flag of New Zealand on
government buildings during
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitangi_Day">Waitangi Day</a>. Tino
Rangatiratanga still has no official status in New&nbsp;Zealand.</p>

For this months screening we wanted to pick a film that didn’t rely on a stereotypical image of indigenous people. Once Were Warriors is a New Zealand film from 1994 depicting the struggles of a contemporary Maori family in an urban setting. This film was both praised and criticized for its depiction of alcoholism and domestic violence. Some viewed the film as bravely tackling the sad but realistic challenges of some families while others felt that it would negatively impact the way that people view&nbsp;Maoris.</p>
<p>As usual, expect a preshow that will last around a half hour. The preshow will be our attempt at setting some cultural context to life in New Zealand pre 1990’s; a little pop culture and history mashup. Early birds will be treated to a 1964 claymation&nbsp;short☺.</p>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who came to the <a href="http://reyqua.com/indigenous-people#Movie-Screening:-Once-Were-Warriors">movie screening</a> event. It went really well, we had almost a full house and our audience was really pleased. Afterwards we had a lengthy discussion about the role of indegenous people in modern society. Now for those of you that came, we have a surprise <em>haka</em>, namely the <em>Aunty Missy, surprise haka</em>, marginally related to the show. We hope you enjoy it as&nbsp;much.

This is probably mostly due to the fact that I didn’t take any interest in being Japanese until I was in my teenage years and mostly grew up in the United States, but also partly due to the fact that the Japanese government has severely suppressed indigenous groups. Infact, its been less than a decade since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people">Ainu</a>, the indigenous people of the north were recognized as an official minority. While I don’t have any blood connection to the Ainu or to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_people">Ryukyuan</a> of the south (that I am aware of), they are my closest ties to indigenous people next to my upbringing with Pacific Northwest Native American culture (which hardly counts as any&nbsp;connection).</p>
<p>I’ve spent some time looking for good videos and articles to inform myself and to share with everyone and in the process I have come to some conclusions. Of the two groups, Ainu and Ryukyuan, there is far more information available about the Ainu. There are many historical ethnographic photos and even films of the Ainu and modern interviews but there seems to be very little evidence that the Ryukyuan are even a distinct group other than their sadly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyuan_languages">endangered languages</a>. This just goes to show what a powerful suppressive force the Japanese government can be. Additionally, in my search I learned of yet another group of people, on Hachijo Island south of Tokyo who speak an older form of Japanese. They are not considered an indigenous group, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the same suppressive forces were at&nbsp;play.</p>
<p>Here is a kind of dated video (90’s), but it shows pretty well how the Ainu fit into Japanese society, their struggle for recognition and their effort to continue traditional&nbsp;practices.</p>

I thought it would be interesting to spend some of my time here focusing on the native peoples of the region. Maybe I can gather some information in person rather than just relying on the internets to tell me everything. So expect this initial post, but then I’ll try to keep adding more to the topic in the comments section (this is sort of our vision for how the website should work). And as always, feel free to add to the comments with your own content or just&nbsp;feedback.</p>
<p>I lived in San Francisco for seven years and although I found out bits and pieces about the Alhone and Miwok people it was pretty cursory. I’d like to know more and share it because as a transplant or visitor to San Francisco there is almost no obvious evidence of a native culture, but of course, there must have been people here before. Its just less apparent than say, the Pacific Northwest where I grew up (but still didn’t really have any close contact with native peoples because of the the whole reservation system and&nbsp;such).</p>

<p>Somewhere on a small residential street of San Francisco a nondescript plaque&nbsp;reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>On June 29<span class="ord">th</span> 1776 Father Francisco Palou, a member of the Anza expedition, had a brushwood shelter built here on the edge of a now vanished lake, Lago de Los Dolores (Lake of the sorrows), and offered the first mass. The first mission was a log and thatch structure dedicated on october 9, 1776 when the necessary church documents arrived. The present Mission Dolores was dedicated in&nbsp;1791.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the so called birth place of San Francisco as we know it today and a block away is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_San_Francisco_de_As%C3%ADs">Mission Dolores, or Mission San Francisco de&nbsp;Asís</a>.</p>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="http://www.sanfranciscodays.com/postcards/large/pc395-mission-dolores-photo.jpg" alt="Mission Dolores"></figure><p></p>
<p>Today Mission Dolores is an active church and a tourist attraction/trap, you can pay some amount of money and take a tour. And by this point some of you may be wondering how this is at all relevant. Well, if you take the tour or go around back like I do, you’ll see one of two remaining San Francisco cemeteries. Along with Friars and pioneers lay thousands of unnamed Native Americans in a mass grave. All other dead bodies take the 15 minute trip out of town to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colma,_California">necropolis of Colma</a> (another fascinating story). When the spanish came to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a>, then Mexico, they set up missions (church/military compounds) to assimilate the native population, luring them in with material goods, relocating some of them and often holding them against their will. In the early days new missions were built with Native labor (slave or&nbsp;otherwise).</p>
<p></p><figure class="image"><img src="http://archive.cyark.org/content/preview/350/historic-photograph-of-the-mission-dolores-cemetery-in-1936.jpg" alt="Mission Dolores Cemetery"></figure><p></p>
<p>So sadly today, visible remains of Native American presence in San Francisco is reduced to a mass grave and a plaque or two. I have also seen the Native American Council and birthing center on my old street, but its in a dicey spot with a locked door, otherwise I would go in there asking&nbsp;around.</p>

I first came to Africa in 2006 as an ‘idiot abroad.’ I called myself the idiot, because the culture was so vast, abnormal, scary and something that made my stomach flutter from my nerves of interacting with the people that I couldn’t understand or comprehend the cultural norms. Do I bow? Smile? Shake nervously? Or none of the above. I didn’t know how to act or feel, but I was excited to share my culture, and learn&nbsp;theirs.</p>
<p>I went to Kenya, and spent my time in a remote village on the western side of the country. I called Ebukolo my home for three months. I lived in a small mud hut, made from cow dung, dirt and small sticks to help provide support. I fetched my water from a small river, down a long hill, and carried it back to the small home that sat on a small property with a larger home to share the&nbsp;land.</p>
<p>I sat in darkness during the night. Sat under a large tree, watching children play during the day, and continued my daily chores, as if it was part of my normal routine. I got up every day, ate my breakfast, and then made the short walk to a small school, where I taught English as a volunteer. I returned home, cleaned the house, washed my clothes by hand in a bucket and laid them out to dry. Checked my water supply, and if needed, made the mile journey to the small river. Upon returning, I went to the local market, made of two kiosks, which sold modest goods and purchased what was needed for the evening&nbsp;dinner.</p>
<p>I learned from the locals how to live and survive with what they had, and not with what they could buy. I learned to work the land, and grind maize to make a local dish. I learned to plant, care for the cows, milk them and let them graze the land. I learned how to kill the animals and use everything they gave, in order to make their life meaningful. However, the most important thing learned, was that community helped in whatever way they could. This was evident when I came across a local women who was homeless. She had dirt that covered her face, because she was eating it to get the iron. The women who shared the property with me, my host mother, rushed to her side, invited the homeless women into the home, gave her a meal. She talked with her and soon sent her on her way. I told my host mother that it was kind to see her take care of this women in the way she did. However, my host mother didn’t understand why I praised her for an action that everyone in the village did as a normal way of life. She was a member of the community, therefore, it was everyone’s responsibility to take care of&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>One day I ate a pastry that was being sold on the side of the streets. To this day, I don’t know what the pastry was made from, but I do know that it made me sick. When my host mother came across me throwing up, she rushed me into the home. I knew why I was sick, and I knew that it would pass, but the look on her face did not share the same sentiment. After about thirty minutes of me throwing up and then rushing to the outhouse, she sent her son to the school to fetch the reverend. Not a doctor, or a nurse, or a car that could take me to the hospital, she wanted the reverend, to heal my wounds and pray for my safety. It wasn’t rational, but it was what she knew. He returned promptly, with his family, other colleagues and a few more individuals that I didn’t know. I laid on the bed, sweating, unsure of when I would throw up again. The reverend grabbed my hand, and&nbsp;prayed.</p>
<p>The rest of the community gathered around and prayed for my safety. They prayed to god that I would survive, make it to tomorrow. All I really wanted was to be left alone, allowed to sleep, and rest through the night. What I got was a community who cared, who looked out for their own, and made sure that the people they cared for was&nbsp;okay.</p>
<p>That was the start of a lesson that I learned about Africa, the community is strong, not from the individual or the chief, but strong because of the individuals. Everyone has a responsibility to raise the children, everyone has a responsibility to take care of the elderly and everyone has a responsibility to share with each other what they have to&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>What you think you know about Africa, think again. We often see only the negative part of Africa, and we have very strong images of this place, full of violence, full of hatred, full of political unrest, but I see the culture of Africa as peaceful. A place that has their moments of violence, and problems, but people that care for one another. Perhaps there are many lessons that we can learn from the indigenous people’s way of life. We can learn to use what we have, live off the land, and care for one another, as if they are&nbsp;family.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When the Soviet Union dissolved in the early 90’s, the western states
needed to find a place for the ex-soviet states with in the world
order. The integration of the <span class="caps">CEE</span> states and the sheer willingness of
both parties to unite can in my view be explained through a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism">social constructivist approach</a>
but also through a rational one, even to the extent of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmentalism#European_Integration">liberal intergovernmentalism</a>. Two
compelling arguments can be made to justify either&nbsp;view:</p>
<h3># Rational argument&nbsp;###</h3>
<p>Armed conflict had broken out between national groups within the
region and the risk of ethnic tension spiralling out of control was
considered high. The <span class="caps">EU</span> and <span class="caps">NATO</span> could not just stand by as the
situation either calmed down or escalated. Given that the prime
concern was to ensure the power balance within Europe, and to secure
further development of the capitalized world, the integration of the
<span class="caps">CEE</span> countries was considered&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<h3># Socially constructive argument&nbsp;###</h3>
<p>Most of the <span class="caps">CEE</span> states did openly express their eagerness to rejoin
Europe as soon as the iron curtain fell and in that light the European
Council announced ‘that the associated countries in Central and
Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European
Union.’ (Nugent, 2010, p. 42). The announcement was followed by a list
of conditions, the Copenhagen criteria, which the <span class="caps">CEEC</span>’s had to meet,
but the spirit of the announcement suggests a European identity of
share values and norms and thus a social constructive&nbsp;explanation.</p>
<p>In order to determine which one of these arguments give a more
accurate picture of the <span class="caps">CEEC</span> integration we need to examine more
closely the actions and decisions made by both parties, leading to,
and during the accession negotiations. By examining the rule transfer
process I believe I can decipher if the <span class="caps">CEEC</span> integration was driven by
security issues or by a shared European identity. In that regard I
base my analysis on Frank Schimmelfennig’s and Ulrich Sedelmeier’s
2004 article Governance by conditionality: <span class="caps">EU</span> rule transfer to the
candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Will Kymlicka’s
analysis of the <span class="caps">CEEC</span>/<span class="caps">EU</span> relations in <em>Multicultural Odysseys –
Navigating the new International Politics of Diversity</em> 2007.
Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier analyze the case through a ‘governance
approach’ and look specifically at how those rules and norms where
transferred. Although ‘government approaches’ are generally used for
‘policy network analysis’ within the <span class="caps">EU</span>, Schimmelfenning and
Sedelmeier claim that it serves a useful tool for external relations
analysis as well (Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 1). To look
more closely at the issue of national minorities Kymlicka’s analysis
offers a vital insight of the case, for he believes that in order to
fully secure democracy as a just international norm; we must first and
foremost secure the rights and autonomy of national minority
groups. Only then can we create a normative foundation for developing
human rights, without which democracy is nothing but an illusion
(Kymlicka, 2001, p. 69). Whether or not the <span class="caps">EU</span> offered membership to
the <span class="caps">CEEC</span> based on self-interests or not can by determined from
Kymlicka’s&nbsp;analysis.</p>
<h3>Approaching governance</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_criteria">The Copenhagen criteria</a>
included various issues of reforms, including minority rights in the
region. From the liberal multiculturalist point of view the <span class="caps">CEEC</span>
integration process offered an opportunity to address humanitarian
issues regarding the mistreatment of national minorities in the
post-communist states. The <span class="caps">EU</span> did without a doubt manage to diffuse
humanitarian norms from the west, to the east, but it’s been a matter
of some debate if the method and the norms themselves did to any
extent offer a permanent&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>The integration process was time-consuming and involved hard
negotiations as the pending member states where expected to meet the
demanding conditions of the Copenhagen criteria (and subsequently the
<em>acquis communautaire</em>), including economic, democratic and humanitarian
reforms (Nugent, 2010, p. 43). The <span class="caps">EU</span>’s strategy was to implement a
rule transfer scheme in order to elevate the candidate countries to
Western-European standard so that their new membership wouldn’t have a
negative impact on the <span class="caps">EU</span>’s&nbsp;prosperity.</p>
<p>In Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier’s article they offer three different
models of the <span class="caps">EU</span>’s external governance on <span class="caps">CEEC</span>’s rule adoption and
analyze their effectiveness in implementing <span class="caps">EU</span> legislation into
domestic law: ‘The social learning model’, ‘the lesson-drawing model’
and ‘the external incentives model’, which seemed to be applied the
most.  The logic behind the ‘the external incentives model’ was to
uses carrots and sticks as conditions to further&nbsp;accession.</p>
<p>Overall the rule transfer proved rather context-dependent. The
democratic conditionality turned out to be least effective, as none of
the three modes contributed to that area, especially for the most
nationalist and authoritarian states. This can be explained by the
fact that democratic reforms threatened the power position of the
political elite which found the adoption cost to be too high
(Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 10). Of the three models ‘the
external incentive model’ seemed most effective in regards to the
<em>acquis</em> conditionality, especially when applied with a credible
membership perspective. Also the <em>acquis</em> conditionality did not
interfere as much with domestic power politics as the democratization&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>The social learning and lesson drawing models explained economic
reforms and environmental issues in some cases as those rules had
been implemented before the <span class="caps">EU</span> set the bar. This was also the case
with Hungary and Poland as they had started working on minority
protection as soon as the Soviet Union seized to exist. Also, in
regards to those alternative models ‘the presence or absence of
epistemic communities promoting <span class="caps">EU</span> rules emerges as a key factor’
(Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 13). The external incentives
model is a rather rational approach to the integration process of the
<span class="caps">CEEC</span> countries. It rests on various factors but they conclude that the
effectiveness of rule transfer rests primarily on the willingness of
the third country to join the union. All of the <span class="caps">CEEC</span> countries
expressed their will to join the <span class="caps">EU</span> as soon as the iron curtain fell
(Nugent, 2010, p. 47). With that fact in mind, and also because they
had nowhere else to go, the <span class="caps">EU</span> was in full control of negotiations
with an strong bargaining position capable of offering rewards hard to
resist. This can lead to a seemingly coercive rule transfer, which
might prove ineffective in the long run as the rules for the
enlargement acquis where designed for accession candidates and not
binding for full members (Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004, p.&nbsp;16).</p>
<p>Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier found evidence implying that ‘[r]ules
that are transferred through social learning or lesson-drawing are
much less contested domestically (Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004,
p. 14).  Concluding that if the <span class="caps">CEE</span> countries where conditioned,
instead of persuaded, to accept external governance through
cost-benefit analysis they might reverse some, or even all, of the
reforms as soon as membership is insured. In other words, the carrot
and stick strategy only works while the carrot hangs on the
string. They also noted that some member states and parts of the
Commission ‘indicated that rather superficial alignment would not
present an obstacle to concluding negotiations in the areas of <span class="caps">EU</span>
social policy’ (Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004, p.&nbsp;13).</p>
<h3>Minority rights and&nbsp;autonomy</h3>
<p>In order to understand Will Kymlicka’s point of view we must look in
to his philosophical premise. As a political philosopher his work has
to a large extent revolved around the ontological misunderstanding of
western individualism as a building block of human
society. Rational/liberal individualism can be traced back to the
political analysis of the enlightenment from
<em>state-of-nature-theorists</em> and philosophers such as David Hume, John
Locke, Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Although not fully
compatible theorists they share a fundamental ontological view of the
individual as a rational being, forming a societal realm of
governance.  Kymlicka fears that by accepting the ontological view of
a ‘bottom up’ social structure, it will lead to a normative
homogeneity and injustices towards national minorities and indigenous
people. He argues that individuals form identities through interaction
with their socially constructed reality, indicating a ‘bottom up/top
down’ ontology. Liberal western individualism in fact assumes one
world view, cosmopolitanism, which denies those who wish to define
their individuality from their national culture from leading a
meaningful life. As an attempt to prevent the injustice of
homogenising nation states Kymlicka suggests a diffusing of liberal
multicultural models of the state and citizenship through
International organizations (Kymlicka, 2001, p.&nbsp;307).</p>
<p>In his view, <em>institutionalizing</em> minority rights is of the outmost
importance and the key to a stabilized Europe once the <span class="caps">CEEC</span>’s join the
<span class="caps">EU</span>. The solution rests not only in institutionalizing minority rights
on the basis of the <span class="caps">UN</span>’s declaration of ‘generic minority rights’
which applies to all ethnocultural minorities, but through ‘targeted
rights’. ‘Targeted rights’ apply to particular types of minorities
‘such as indigenous peoples, national minorities, immigrants, the
Roma/gypsies, and so on’ (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 199). Kymlicka claims
that the initial drive for the <span class="caps">EU</span>’s initial 1990 <span class="caps">OSCE</span> Copenhagen
Declaration was a ‘complex mixture of humanitarian, self interested,
and ideological, reasons’ (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 174). The declaration
strongly supported minority rights and endorsed territorial autonomy
for national minorities. Following the declaration Kymlicka identifies
three strategies formulated by the <span class="caps">EU</span> to help improve state-minority
relations: ‘Publicizing best practices’; ‘formulating minimum
standard’; and ‘case specific interventions’.  All of the three tracks
failed miserably according to Kymlicka. The best practices strategy,
designed to introduce previously successful western models of
minority-majority relations, simply failed to convey the message for
the epistemic community completely overlooked the underlying cultural
difference between eastern and western Europe. When confronted with
the problem in the west, most of the humanitarian norms we take for
granted already&nbsp;existed.</p>
<p>By formulating minimum standards, and this brings us to
Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier and the external incentive model, the
<span class="caps">EU</span> made a number of tremendous mistakes leading to the abandonment of
useful multicultural norms. In 1993 all of the major European
organizations had developed a consensus to establish minimum norms and
standards of minority groups, and they all endorsed territorial
autonomy. The problem was that no one seemed to have a clear idea what
these standards should be or how to formulate them. Again the
epistemic community failed as the short timeframe resulted in norms
with serious limitations (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 199). Another critical
issue regarding minimum standards and probably the main reason for the
failure of the whole experiment was the fact that these minimum
standards were off course intended to apply to all member states of
the <span class="caps">EU</span>. But as it turned out, the current member states could not
abide to that. ‘While they were willing to insist that the
post-communist states be monitored for their treatment of minorities,
Western democracies did not want their own treatment of national
minorities examined (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 210). By resisting their own
norm diffusion the western part of the <span class="caps">EU</span> self-destructed further
progress leading to the diffusion of minority self-government. As the
post-communist countries strongly opposed all ideas in that matter,
based on security reasons, the idea was dropped and subsequently all
efforts to promote something like liberal multiculturalism disappeared
(Kymlicka, 2007, p. 211). The case specific interventions according to
Kymlicka are misleading and rest on the logic of security instead of
multiculturalism. Conflict prevention may turn out effective but it
results in a <em>double-standard-dilemma</em> as the actions taken by the <span class="caps">EU</span>
‘have demonstrated their preparedness to follow any policy measure to
create stability’ (Kymlicka, 2007, p. 233). Kymlicka concludes by
saying that it has become the norm to deal with minority issues in the
post-communist states by calculating actions about how to restore
security. In his view the <span class="caps">CEEC</span> integration process opened a window for
implementing a liberal-multicultural norm for all of Europe, ‘but the
window has gradually closed, with the job only half-done (Kymlicka,
2007, p.&nbsp;315).</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Even though Kymlica’s analysis rested on a much narrower viewpoint his
conclusions are consistent with the findings of Schimmelfenning and
Sedelmeier, which underlines the contextual momentum of state-minority
relations in the <span class="caps">CEEC</span>/<span class="caps">EU</span>&nbsp;relationship.</p>
<p>This case is extremely complicated. Schimmelfenning and Sedelmeier
note that even though the integration of the <span class="caps">CEEC</span> can be explained
initially through a shared European identity, the <span class="caps">EU</span> approached the
accession through a fair share of what is commonly called old
governance (Schimmelfennig <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sedelmeier, 2004, p. 16). The accession
meetings had the aura of an old fashion, top down hegemonies where the
<span class="caps">EU</span> explained what needed to be reformed, how it should be done and
what the prize was in return. It’s obvious that the <span class="caps">EU</span> made a mistake
in going in to the accession negotiations with a “one size fits all”
rule transfer model thus failing to diffuse important humanitarian
norms such as minority rights and sustaining democratic reforms. I
find that the methodology of the rule transfer applied by the <span class="caps">EU</span> to be
rational and that the actors on both sides performed as
utility-maximizers as the <span class="caps">CEE</span> countries where subjected to substantial
external governance. As the case progressed I noted a tendency of self
interests from member states coherent with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_institutionalism">rational choice institutionalism</a>,
but not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_liberalism">liberal institutionalism</a>,
for I found that the states acknowledged the institutional
framework. In the case of member states accepting superficial
alignment to the <em>acquis</em> it indicates a lack of commitment on behalf
of the <span class="caps">EU</span>, and I wonder why. Perhaps they were hoping for the
superficial alignment to spill over into a more determent domestic&nbsp;reforms.</p>
<p>In my view the <span class="caps">EU</span> overestimated the kinship of the formerly divided
continent, hurling the accession negotiation it to a setting of ‘old
politics’ and because of the strong institutional ‘path dependency’
within the <span class="caps">EU</span> framework they lost control of the&nbsp;process.</p>
